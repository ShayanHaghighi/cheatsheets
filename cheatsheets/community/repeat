    1. We don't try to repeat manuals and documentation sites
    2. We don't try to document each and every special usage case of a tool
    3. We try to find and gather the most interesting usage cases

 tldr:cargo-tree 
# cargo tree
# Display a tree visualization of a dependency graph.
# Note: in the tree, dependencies of packages marked with `(*)` have already been shown elsewhere in the graph, and so are not repeated.

# Show all occurrences of repeated dependencies:
cargo tree --no-dedupe
